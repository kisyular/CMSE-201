    "## Goals for this assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "For your data analysis project, you have been asked to find and analyze a publicly-available dataset, and to use that analysis to answer questions asked of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The point of this assignment** is to give you in-depth experience working with a dataset, coming up with questions, and doing data analysis and visualization to answer those questions.  In two weeks you'll be asked to turn in some preliminary analysis, and two weeks after that the final analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You first need to find two public datasets, and identify some questions that you can answer with those datasets.  Some places that you can look are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Data.gov - Federal](http://www.data.gov)\n",
    "- [Data.gov - State of Michigan](http://data.michigan.gov)\n",
    "- [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com)\n",
    "- [Data.world](http://data.world)\n",
    "- [A large list of public datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)\n",

    "**Briefly describe** the two datasets that you presented to your group (a sentence or two for each, including a link to where you found the datasets and the kinds of questions that you might ask of each dataset).  Which dataset are you going to analyze, and why did you choose that one?"

    "    3. Reasons why fire department stations are constantly increasing and decreasing in the course of the dataset\n",
    "    4. How to predict the number of fire cases in future using the trend show in the past year\n",
    "For dataset Two: \"Titanic Accident\":\n",
    "    1. I want to see the correlation of gender and the number of deaths in sea transport\n",
    "    2. Any relationship between the Cabin and the amount of death reported per cabin\n",
